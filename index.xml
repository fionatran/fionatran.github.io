      <description>I am helping design the interface for medical device programming software, generating prototypes and design specifications, then conducting formative and summative usability testing and design verification. My goal is to ensure minimal safety risks to the patient and clinicians, and that the product complies with the IEC 62366-1:2015 standard and FDA guidance on human factors and usability engineering for medical devices.
This product has not been launched yet, so while I cannot show details on the project, below is my general workflow:</description>

      <description>Problem Electrical power grid operation is growing in complexity, and the threat of catastrophic outages has led to new regulatory standards requiring that power grid operators have wide-area views of the grid.
I designed and evaluated wide-area visualizations to help operators monitor wide areas of the North American power grid, both within and outside of their own jurisdictions.
Impact Working with end users, IT developers, senior management, and a fellow human factors researcher, I recommended UX improvements to the industry partner, conducted a work analysis, and set up the foundation for their operational human performance initiative.</description>

      <description>Problem Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of respiratory diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. Allowing COPD patients to self-manage their disease can reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits.
I helped develop a mobile application called breatheAgain to help Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) patients manage their disease. In a team of 4, we conducted an operating experience review, functional analysis, and hierarchical task analysis before developing low- and high-fidelity prototypes.</description>
