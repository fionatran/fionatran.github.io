      <description>I am leading human factors and UX activities for an upcoming app that will allow clinicians to check and control settings for implantable medical devices. These activities include designing and prototoyping the user experience, analyzing use-related risks, and conducting formative and summative usability testing and design verification. Prior to this role, I was the human factors test lead for multiple releases of a similar app.
My goal is to ensure minimal safety risks to the patient and clinicians, and that the product complies with the IEC 62366 standard and FDA guidance on usability engineering for medical devices.</description>

      <description>Problem Electrical power grid operation is growing in complexity, and the threat of catastrophic outages has led to new regulatory standards requiring that power grid operators have wide-area views of the grid.
I designed and evaluated wide-area visualizations to help operators monitor wide areas of the North American power grid, both within and outside of their own jurisdictions.
Impact Working with end users, IT developers, senior management, and a fellow human factors researcher, I recommended UX improvements to the industry partner, conducted a work analysis, and set up the foundation for their operational human performance initiative.</description>

      <description>Problem Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of respiratory diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. Allowing COPD patients to self-manage their disease can reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits.
I helped develop a mobile application called breatheAgain to help Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) patients manage their disease. In a team of 4, we conducted an operating experience review, functional analysis, and hierarchical task analysis before developing low- and high-fidelity prototypes.</description>
