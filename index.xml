      <description>I am leading human factors and UX activities for an upcoming app and hardware system that will allow clinicians to check and control settings for cardiac medical devices, such as implantable pacemakers and defibrillators. These activities include:
 Facilitating preliminary user research Designing and prototyping the user experience Analyzing use-related risks Conducting formative and summative usability testing Documenting risk analyses, design specifications, and testing results  My goals are to create an intuitive user experience with minimal safety risks to patients and clinicians, improve the patient care pathway, and achieve compliance to US and international regulatory standards.</description>

      <description>Problem Electrical power grid operation is growing in complexity, and the threat of catastrophic outages has led to new regulatory standards requiring that power grid operators have wide-area views of the grid.
I designed and evaluated wide-area visualizations to help operators monitor wide areas of the North American power grid, both within and outside of their own jurisdictions.
Impact Working with end users, IT developers, senior management, and a fellow human factors researcher, I recommended UX improvements to the industry partner, conducted a work analysis, and set up the foundation for their operational human performance initiative.</description>

      <description>Problem Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of respiratory diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing-related problems. Allowing COPD patients to self-manage their disease can reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits.
I helped develop a mobile application called breatheAgain to help Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD) patients manage their disease. In a team of 4, we conducted an operating experience review, functional analysis, and hierarchical task analysis before developing low- and high-fidelity prototypes.</description>
