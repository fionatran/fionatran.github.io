<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>Electrical power grid operation is growing in complexity, and the threat of catastrophic outages has led to new regulatory standards requiring that power grid operators have wide-area views of the grid.</p>

<p>I designed and evaluated wide-area visualizations to help operators monitor wide areas of the North American power grid, both within and outside of their own jurisdictions.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<p>Working with end users, IT developers, senior management, and a fellow human factors researcher, I recommended UX improvements to the industry partner, conducted a work analysis, and set up the foundation for their operational human performance initiative.</p>

<p>The design and evaluation process was published in <em>Ergonomics in Design</em>, and the article was awarded the <em>Ergonomics in Design</em> 2017 Best Article Award. I presented the paper at the HFES Annual Meeting in 2018. We also presented the industry collaboration at the NERC Human Performance Conference, and published a conference paper and book chapter.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<h3 id="knowledge-elicitation">Knowledge Elicitation</h3>

<p>I conducted <strong>critical incident interviews</strong> with current power grid operators, in a format adapted from the Critical Incident Technique (Flanagan 1954). Questions focused on past incidents that operators experienced first-hand in the control room, with the goal of designing to avoid past pitfalls.</p>

<p>My colleague and I led <strong>focus group sessions</strong> with 6 crews of 7 operators each, where crews discussed past incidents while drawing from the experiences of the entire crew that dealt with the incident. At the end of the session, we handed out a <strong>questionnaire</strong> on control room ergonomics and software tool development.</p>

<p>Throughout this project, we did <strong>field observations</strong> in the control room over a period of 60+ non-consecutive days, to see how operators dealt with real-time events.</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>We analyzed our findings from knowledge elicitation (above), and documentation/literature review. We conducted a <strong>Work Domain Analysis</strong> (WDA) of power grid operations, which has been published as a chapter of <a href="https://www.crcpress.com/Cognitive-Work-Analysis-Applications-Extensions-and-Future-Directions/Stanton-Salmon-Walker-Jenkins/p/book/9781138749429">Cognitive Work Analysis: Applications, Extensions and Future Directions</a>.</p>

<p>I used the WDA to develop <strong>information requirements</strong> for designing wide-area monitoring visualizations for power grid operation.</p>

<h3 id="design-and-validation">Design and Validation</h3>

<p>I made <strong>low-fidelity sketches</strong> using those information requirements, then conducted informal <strong>tabletop feedback</strong> discussions with 4 operators individually. They provided feedback and information on their information needs, so that I could iterate on those low-fidelity sketches.</p>

<p>I then developed <strong>high-fidelity prototypes</strong>. I conducted a <strong>usability evaluation</strong> where operators answered 11 task questions based on the information in the displays. They then provided open-ended feedback on what they liked about the design and what could be improved. The usability evaluation ended with a questionnaire, including questions from the System Usability Scale.</p>
